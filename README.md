CamChess is a free open source program that enables you to play against a computer with a standard tournament board and pieces. It uses a camera to identify moves on the board. It is optimised for a standard tournament vinyl roll up board with green squares and black and "light wood" coloured plastic pieces. It currently uses a Raspberry Pi Zero W with an attached ZeroCam to capture board images. The Pi Zero talks to my desktop computer over WiFi. The repository contains PiCam.py which runs on the Pi Zero, and CamChess.py which runs on a my desktop computer. Both programs are written in Python, and CamChess.py uses OpenCV and python-chess.
